Colour-based Object Detector

- Check if number of input arguments are correct for given mode and exit if incorrect

Show Calibration File
- If calibration file could not open exit
- Read the data from the text file and display in required format

Calibration
- Read bmp file and establish the starting point (bottom left) of centre window 
- Store the hues of each pixel in the centre window above the threshold of saturation and value
- Sort the hues in ascending order with duplicates as neighbours
- Determine the middle hue and max hue difference of stored hues
- Display calibration data

Detection
- Read and make a copy of the image
- If calibration file could not open exit
- Check each pixel based on calibration data
- Write potential objects as white and everything else as black in threshold image
- Perform recursive Depth First Search on each potential object pixel and its neighbours which havent been visited yet
- Find distinct regions greater then 20x20 and print bounding box around object
